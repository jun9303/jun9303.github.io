Exploring Central Vietnam in early 2023

In Da Nang, the biggest city in Central Vietnam, the streets buzzed with the sound of countless motorcycles, giving the city a lively feel. I discovered some great massage shops that offered a peaceful break from the busy urban scene. Da Nang, with its lively charm, set the stage for a memorable adventure. Exploring beyond the city, I visited Ba Na Hills, where the Golden Hands Bridge stood out as the highlight. With its stunning natural backdrop, this architectural marvel not only provided a unique view but also a deep connection with the surrounding wonders. Ba Na Hills offered a perfect mix of excitement and calm, providing a peaceful escape that complemented the vibrant energy of Da Nang.

Continuing my journey, Hoi An appeared as a timeless masterpiece, a town frozen in historical charm. The coconut boat tour, a leisurely ride through calm waterways, offered a quiet contrast to the lively atmosphere of Da Nang. As the sun set, the Hoi An night market came to life with colorful lanterns, lively street vendors, and the enticing smell of local food. Amidst the hustle and bustle, the traditional Vietnamese attire, ao dai, added a cultural touch to my Hoi An experience.
