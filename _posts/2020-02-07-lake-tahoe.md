Lab ski trip to Lake Tahoe from 11/26/19 to 11/28/19.

Lake Tahoe in early February was still cold and the mountain covered with snow around the lake were crowded with skiers and snowboarders. It was amazing that I could enjoy skiing with breathtaking, spectacular panoramic views of the lake and sky.
