Visiting Southern California for the first time in 5 years!

The pandemic has devastated many of my travel plans in the States since its outbreak, and SoCal finally became my first out-of-the-Bay-Area trip in 2 years just for fun. With a bit of familiarity to NorCal, I was replenished with good cozy feelings and relaxing vibes in these places.

Special thanks to SC, providing my stays and sharing a ride during the trip :)
