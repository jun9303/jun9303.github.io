Visiting Southern California for the first time in 5 years!

The pandemic has disrupted many of my travel plans in the United States since it broke out, and SoCal finally became my first trip outside of the Bay Area in 2 years just for fun. Feeling a sense of familiarity (in a positive way!) to NorCal, I was rejuvenated with good cozy vibes and relaxing mindsets in these places.

Special thanks to [SC](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seokchanahn/) for providing my accommodations and sharing a ride during the trip :)
