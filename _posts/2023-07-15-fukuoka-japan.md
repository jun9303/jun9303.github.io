Rainy twists amongst city delights and onsen relaxes

Beginning in the tranquil resort place of Yufuin, my stay at Seiko-en Ryokan offered a serene retreat amidst nature's embrace. The private onsen and delectable kaiseki dinner set the stage for relaxation, providing a refreshing start to my Fukuoka trip.

Harsh weather (probably due to recent climate changes) had disrupted our excursion back to Fukuoka City on the second day of the trip. Yet, what seemed like a setback transformed into an unexpected experience. Despite a bit delays, I ended up embarking on a roundabout train tour from Beppu, turning the rain-soaked journey into a memorable detour filled new discoveries.

Returning to Fukuoka City for the final leg of my trip, the bustling streets of Tenjin beckoned with endless shopping opportunities. After the retail joys in Tenjin, I found short moments of serenity at Ohori Park, marveled at Fukuoka Tower, and finished our final itinerary at Momochihama Beach. Each twist and turn of my Fukuoka escape added unforgettable layers to the journey, finding joy at every moment.
