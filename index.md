  - excerpt: "The truth may be puzzling. It may take some work to grapple with. It may be counterintuitive. It may contradict deeply held prejudices. It may not be consonant with what we desperately want to be true. **But our preferences do not determine what's true.** &nbsp; <small>- *Carl Sagan*</small>"

I am a student in the [Department of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering](http://me.snu.ac.kr/eng/default.asp) at [Seoul National University](http://useoul.edu/). I am also majoring in [Business Administration](http://cba.snu.ac.kr/en) as my dual major.

Currently, my research topic is mainly in the area of Fluid Dynamics and Heat Transfer. I have accumulated my own research experience in Flow Measurement & Simulations (e.g. Magnetic Resonance Velocimetry & Large Eddy Simultaion), Conjugate Heat Transfer, and Turbomachinery. Also, I have a deep interest in utilization of Deep Learning techniques into CFD and analysis of multi-phase flow systems.

I was a Researcher in the [Energy and Environmental Flow](http://eeflow.snu.ac.kr/) at Seoul National University, directed by [Dr. Wontae Hwang](http://me.snu.ac.kr/eng/01_intro/faculty_view.asp?pid=137)(Mechanical Engineering). I received my B.Sc. in Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering from SNU *Summa cum laude*, with a thesis writing under [Dr. Heacheon Choi](http://me.snu.ac.kr/eng/01_intro/faculty_view.asp?pid=39).

I am familiar with several programming languages, including Python, Fortran, and MATLAB. As a hobby, I have performed several web design projects with various frameworks (e.g. Python Flask, PHP, jQuery). Hiking, jogging and playing basketball are my favorite outdoor activities.
