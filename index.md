# I AM SANGJOON LEE.

Graduating from [Seoul National University](https://useoul.edu/) with the highest distinction (*Summa Cum Laude*), I was conferred dual Bachelor's degrees in [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](http://me.snu.ac.kr/en) (B.Sc.) and [Business Administration](http://cba.snu.ac.kr/en) (B.B.A.). In the graduation ceremony, I received my degrees as a representative of the engineering undergraduates at SNU in the class of 2018. Currently I am a Ph.D. student in [Mechanical Engineering](https://me.berkeley.edu/) at [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) advised by [Dr. Philip S. Marcus](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/philip-s-marcus/).

My research topic is mainly in the area of Fluid Dynamics. I have accumulated my own research experience in Computational Fluid Dynamics, Experimental Flow Measurement (e.g. Magnetic Resonance Velocimetry), Conjugate Heat Transfer, and relevant engineering applications. Furthermore, I am deeply interested in utilization of Deep Learning techniques for CFD and analysis of multi-phase flow systems.

I was a researcher in the [Energy and Environmental Flow Lab](http://eeflow.snu.ac.kr/) at SNU, directed by [Dr. Wontae Hwang](http://me.snu.ac.kr/node/141). Under the guidance of [Dr. Haecheon Choi](http://me.snu.ac.kr/node/116), I wrote my B.Sc. thesis, "Large eddy simulation of flow around a rotating small vertical axis wind turbine using an immersed boundary method."

I am familiar with several programming languages, including Python, Fortran and MATLAB, and often utilize them for research projects. As a hobby, I have performed several web design projects with various frameworks (e.g. Python Flask, PHP, jQuery). Hiking, jogging and playing basketball are my favorite outdoor activities.
