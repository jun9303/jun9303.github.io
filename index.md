# I am Sangjoon "Joon" Lee.

I will be joining [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/) as a postdoctoral fellow at the [Center for Turbulence Research (CTR)](https://ctr.stanford.edu/) starting in October 2024.

My research focuses primarily on Fluid Mechanics and Computational Science. I have developed expertise in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques, experimental flow measurements (e.g., magnetic resonance velocimetry), conjugate heat transfer analyses, vortex instabilities, and aero-/hydrodynamic flow optimizations, as well as related engineering problems. Additionally, I am deeply interested in integrating Machine Learning (ML)-based optimization schemes into CFD and analyzing particle-laden flow systems numerically.

In August 2024, I completed my Doctorate (Ph.D.) and Master's (M.S.) degrees in [Mechanical Engineering](https://me.berkeley.edu/) with a designated emphasis in [Computational and Data Science and Engineering](https://data.berkeley.edu/decdse/) at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), under the guidance of [Dr. Philip S. Marcus](https://me.berkeley.edu/people/philip-s-marcus/). In August 2018, I graduated from [Seoul National University](https://useoul.edu/) (SNU) with dual Bachelor's degrees with highest honors (*summa cum laude*) in [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](http://me.snu.ac.kr/en) (B.S.) and [Business Administration](http://cba.snu.ac.kr/en) (B.B.A.).

<!-- I was a researcher in the [Energy and Environmental Flow Lab](http://eeflow.snu.ac.kr/) at SNU, directed by [Dr. Wontae Hwang](http://me.snu.ac.kr/node/141). Under the guidance of [Dr. Haecheon Choi](http://me.snu.ac.kr/node/116), I wrote my B.S. thesis, "Large eddy simulation of flow around a rotating small vertical axis wind turbine using an immersed boundary method." -->

I am familiar with several programming languages, including Python, Fortran, C++, and MATLAB, which I frequently use for research or software development projects. As a form of light entertainment, I have undertaken small web development projects using various frameworks (e.g., Python Flask, PHP, jQuery). In my free time, I enjoy running and hiking.
